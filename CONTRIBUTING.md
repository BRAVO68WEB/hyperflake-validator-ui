None of the below is required, just some points that may make things go smoother.

If you have any questions, add me on Discord `vegeta897#7777`

## Issues

- ✍ Please use descriptive titles. I would rather have a long and wordy title than a short one that is too vague
- ✨ An issue doesn't have to be a problem - it can be a feature request, a question, a neutral comment, or even a thank-you message 💙

## Pull Requests

- 💡 You may want to create an issue or add me on Discord to discuss your addition/change before you work on it
- 💅 Use `npm run format` to automatically match your code style to the repo
- ⚙ I currently don't use a dev branch, so go ahead and target main
